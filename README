=====

In order to build, please run ./makefile
The file already has executing permissions.

There's an example of run, that could be run
only after the building is finished, 
and done by executing ./run_example.txt
The output for this run can be found:
Errors in errors.txt
Output in output.txt

Also the produced files can be found inside Input,
with the relevant extensions (.ext, .ent, .ob).
